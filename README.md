# unity-liftoff
A simple game where you thrust and rotate a rocket through various levels and obstacles and try to get onto the landing pad and get to the next level.
Rotate your rocket with A and D, use the spacebar to thrust as well as some other secret debug keys. This game was made with the guidance of the GameDev.tv course Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D course on udemy. This game was made to learn how to load multiple levels in a specific order as well as respawn the player upon failure. Basics of AudioClips as well as fundamentals of the unity particle system were also used. Mathf.Sin was used to create smooth object movement/oscillation and basics of lighting and skyboxes were also tackled.
**This game will most likely be updated with more levels and features over time**
